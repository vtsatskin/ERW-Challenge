# Explosive Remnants of War and Land Mine Reporting Apps Challenge

> Each year, a large number of civilians are killed and injured by unexploded weapons such as artillery shells, land mines, mortars, grenades and bombs. These explosive remnants of war (ERW) regularly disrupt daily civilian life in post-war and conflict zones.

This is an attempt to address this issue.

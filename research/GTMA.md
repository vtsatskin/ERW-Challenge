Note: all quoted text is from the aforementioned publibcation.

## Landmines

- Some are buried underground
- Others are placed on stakes or fixed to objects
- Activated by:
  - Pressure
  - Trip wire
  - Electrical command
  - Magnetic influence
- Uses in Korean and Vietnam wars
  - Korea
  - Vietnam
  - Cambodia
  - Laos
- Other areas
  - Afghanistan
  - Angola
  - Bosnia-Herzegovina
  - Cambodia
  - Ethiopia
  - Iraq
  - Mozambique
  - Nicaragua
  - Somalia
  - Sudan
- Some IEDs exhibit characteristics of mines.

## Cluster Munitions

> A cluster munition is a conventional munition that is designed to release
multiple submunitions (in some cases called ‘bomblets’) over a large area. The
general definition describes both the container (also called a dispenser or
‘parent munition’) and the submunitions it holds.

- Used in Vietnam war
  - Vietnam
  - Laos
    - ICRC estimates millions of unexploded submunitions remain
    - 11 000 people killed or injured
  - Cambodia
- 1970s to 1990s
  - Afganistan
  - Angola
  - Bosnia-Herzegovina
  - Chad
  - Chechnya
  - Ethiopia
  - Eritrea
  - the Falkland Islands/Malvinas
  - Kosovo
  - Serbia
  - Western Sahara
- Iraq War (2003-2006)
  - US and UK used 13 000 cluster munitions
- Lebanon (2006)
- Used recently in Libya and Syria
  - [Cluster Munition Monitor][CMM] has stats

## Explosive remnants of war

- Two types: unexploded ordnance (UXO) and abandoned explosive ordnance (AXO)

> In some subsistence economies civilians collect items of ordnance for their
value as scrap metal or for the explosives they contain, and children may be
killed or injured while playing with UXO they encounter in their daily lives.

## Extent of Global Contamination

- "After the Guns Fall Silent - The Enduring Legacy of Landmines"
  - Identified 83 countries where landmines have been reported
  - Detailed surveys in:
    - Afghanistan
    - Angola
    - Cambodia
    - Croatia
    - Bosnia-Herzegovina
    - Mozambique

### Types of surveys

> 1. Non-technical surveys (or Level One surveys). Data was gathered through
document searches, questionnaires and interviews with local people to determine
if there was any knowledge of landmines in the area, any casualties etc.
> 2. Technical (or Level Two) surveys. Trained and properly equipped personnel would enter suspected areas to confirm the presence of mines, their type and the
extent of the area contaminated.
> 3. Completion (or Level Three) surveys.
Trained personnel checked an area to ensure that all mines had been cleared.

### Landmine Impact Surveys

> The aim of the LIS was to move away from chasing minefields to focus on the
impact landmines were having on communities, and then use this information to
inform priority-setting.

- Priorities can be set on which areas are the most affected
  - More info can be found in "Crisis, containment and development: the role of the Landmine Impact Survey"
  - Eaton, R. (2003) The Future of Humanitarian Demining. Third World Quarterly, 24(5), 909 – 921.
- 14 Countries have been surveyed by LIS

### Landmine & Cluster Munitions Monitor
- Two annual reports documenting LM and CM in each country in the world
- Contents:
  - identifies countries or areas affected by cluster munition remnants;
  - quantifies the extent of that contamination; and
  - describes the impact they have on communities.
- [Landmine Monitor 2013][LMM]
- [Cluster Munition Monitor 2013][CMM]

## Commercial demining organizations

> A number of commercial companies, such as Royal Ordnance, DSL, ELS, BACTEC,
Mine-Tech and Mechem emerged, evolving through mergers and expansions into an
active commercial industry. Today, international and many national companies
compete for ‘mine action’ contracts for a range of clients serving humanitarian,
development and commercial interests.

## IMAS

> The IMAS provide guidance, establish principles and, in some cases, define
international requirements and specifications. They are designed to improve
safety, efficiency and quality in mine action, and to promote a common and
consistent approach to the conduct of mine action operations.
